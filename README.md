# Say - No-Code AI Pipeline Builder

Say is a proof-of-concept project that empowers users to build AI pipelines without writing a single line of code. With Say, you can create AI agents, each capable of performing a specific task, and connect them together to build more complex and incredible tasks.

## Key Features

- **No-Code AI Builder**: Create AI agents effortlessly using a visual interface, allowing you to define their behavior and tasks without writing code.
- **Pipeline Builder**: Connect your AI agents in a pipeline to perform more complicated tasks by chaining their outputs as inputs for subsequent agents.
- **Microservice Architecture**: Treat AI bots as microservices, enabling them to work together and achieve remarkable results.

## How It Works

Say has two main components:

1. **No-Code AI Builder**: Use the intuitive interface to create AI agents specializing in specific tasks. Define their input requirements, processing logic, and output capabilities without writing a single line of code.

2. **Pipeline Builder**: Connect your AI agents together to create powerful pipelines. Each agent's output serves as input for subsequent agents, allowing you to chain together multiple tasks and achieve complex results.

## Vision and Use Cases

The vision of Say is to treat AI bots as microservices that can be composed together to create incredible tasks. By leveraging this architecture, you can easily create complex services by combining different agents.

For example, imagine creating an AI bot that generates amazing stable-diffusion prompts. Additionally, you can create another bot that knows how to communicate with the stable diffusion model. By connecting these two agents in a pipeline, you can effortlessly create beautiful pictures without manually writing prompts.

The possibilities are endless! Unleash your creativity and explore the potential of Say to build innovative AI-driven solutions.
